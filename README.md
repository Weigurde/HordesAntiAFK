# HordesAntiAFK

A simple and amazing Anti AFK script for GMod Zombie Survival.

# THIS REQUIRES D3BOT!

D3bot is needed in order for this script to work. Do NOT use AzBot, it's outdated. D3bot can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Dadido3/D3bot).

## Installation

Download the AFK script and put it inside the garrysmod addons folder (garrysmod/addons). After that, restart your server and you should be good to go!

## Config

The config is extremely easy and simple. There are 2 files which you can edit, and you can find the config in both of them. Just set them to either true or false. An easy customization for a simple AFK script.

A config file is not set up yet but will be in the future.

## Credit

There is a line of code that i would not like you to remove. It's small in-game and is barely noticable.

```draw.SimpleTextBlur("Created by the_horde (STEAM_0:0:105668971).", "ZSHUDFontTiny", ScrW() / 2, ScrH() / 2 - 520, COLOR_GRAY, TEXT_ALIGN_CENTER)```

Please do not remove this. This is my first somewhat useful addon/script for GMod ZS. Thank you!

If I see you have removed this without permission I will ask for the script to be removed from your server.

## PLEASE READ

THE SCRIPT WILL RECEIVE REGULAR UPDATES AND A CONFIG FILE SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE!

MAKE SURE TO CHECK BACK AND DOWNLOAD THE NEW SCRIPT VERSIONS!

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR SUGGESTIONS ADD ME VIA DISCORD @ the_horde#0001

THANKS FOR DOWNLOADING! <3
